This webpage consists mainly of a password generator that takes personal input from each user and turns that input into a password of varying security and memorability based on the user's preference. Generated passwords range from short solely letter passwords to long strings of uncommon symbols and special characters. The site also contains a brief explanation of how it works at the bottom.
